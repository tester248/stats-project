# Air Quality Index (AQI) Statistical Analysis - Pune

## Project Overview
This mini-project analyzes the Air Quality Index (AQI) dataset for Pune, India. The analysis applies various statistical techniques to understand air quality patterns, variations, and relationships between different pollutants. The goal is to provide actionable insights for policymakers and environmentalists to improve air quality in Pune.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: [Pune Air Quality Index Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraizada/pune-air-quality-index-dataset)

### Limitations
- The dataset may contain missing or inconsistent values, which are handled during preprocessing.
- The analysis is limited to the data provided and may not reflect real-time air quality conditions.

## Statistical Techniques Applied
- Central Limit Theorem demonstration
- Mean analysis
- Variance and Standard Deviation
- Quartile analysis (Q1, Q2, Q3)
- Weighted Mean calculations
- Coefficient of Variation
- Correlation between pollutants
- Regression Lines (Y on X and X on Y)
- Rank Correlation
- Hypothesis Testing (Z-test and T-test)

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Expected Outcomes
- Identification of key pollutants contributing to poor air quality.
- Seasonal and temporal trends in air quality.
- Statistical relationships between different pollutants.
- Recommendations for targeted interventions to improve air quality.
